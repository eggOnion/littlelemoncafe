              Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian,
              who moved
              <br />
              to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a
              restaurant.
              <br />
              <br />
              Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in
              Italy, to craft
              <br />
              the menu
              <br />
              <br />
              Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the
              effort to
              <br />
              expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
              cuisines
              <br />
              from the Mediterranean region.
